## Usage : restream

- Re-stream an M3U playlist with a self hosted proxy server
- Ideal for running on a home server permenantly connected to a VPN, freeing up local watching devices from needing a VPN connection if one is normally required
- Allows multiple watch devices to access the same single channel in the playlist
- Copy settings-example.json to settings.json in the build directory and set the playlist URL to your own URL
- Open a media player on the same machine with http://localhost:3666 to access the local version of the playlist
